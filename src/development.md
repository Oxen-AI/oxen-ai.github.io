# üõ†Ô∏è Development

There are a few ways of getting up and running with Oxen. The most straightforward way is to install the latest pre-built version of Oxen from the [open source repository](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen).

If you are actually going to be writing code, it is important to setup your development environment and start writing some code. This section has resources on how to install Oxen from source, how to build and run Oxen, add your first command, unit test, and how to release a new version of Oxen.
