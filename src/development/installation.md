# üßë‚Äçüíª Installation

How to install the Oxen client, server, or python package. If you are a developer, you will want to [build from source](build_and_run.md). If you are flying by and learning Oxen you can install the python package or the command line tool from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen/releases).

## üíª Command Line Tools

The Oxen client can be installed via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or by downloading the relevant binaries for Linux or Windows.

You can find the source code for the client [here](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen) and can also build for source for your platform. The continuous integration pipeline will build binaries for each release in [this repository](https://github.com/Oxen-AI/Oxen).
